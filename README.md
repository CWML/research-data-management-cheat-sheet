# Research Data Management Cheat Sheet

### Research Data Management Lifecycle 
The research data management lifecycle is an illustration of the research process as it relates to data management. In this system, data is meant to be organized, annotated and stored in ways that will facilitate data sharing and reuse and/or research validation.

#### Project Planning

#### Data Creation / Collection

#### Data Processing

#### Data Analysis

#### Data Sharing / Retention 


### Reserach Data Management Lifecycle + Technology
When you start to think about *how* you would actually engage with any of these steps, different technology aspects come into play, along with themes including version control, documentation, and operational data storage.

##### DMP Tool

##### Data Creation Tools
* Core Research Facilities - Yale’s Core Research Facilities provide Yale researchers access to state of the art scientific instrumentation with the intent to keep Yale’s scientific research at the cutting edge.  Each Core employs highly trained staff that may provide training and assistance with use of instrumentation as well as aid in experimental design. 

##### Data Collection Tools 
* APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)
* Reusing data from data repositories - [strategies for finding appropriate data repositories](https://library.medicine.yale.edu/research-data/find-datasets/data-repositories)
* Reusing data associated with publications [strategies for finding research data for reuse](https://library.medicine.yale.edu/research-data/find-datasets/) 
* EHRs (Electronic Health Records) - [YNHH Epic EHR data pull requests at Yale are places through JDAT (the Joint Data Analytics Team](https://medicine.yale.edu/ycci/researchservices/systems/epic/datarequests/)
* Qualtrics - create and deploy 

##### Data Processing Tools
* Microsoft Excel - [Excel funtions](https://www.excel-easy.com/data-analysis.html) | [Data processing/analysis in Excel](https://www.excel-easy.com/data-analysis.html)
* Python - email medicaldata@yale.edu for a workshop or tutorial based on your research needs
* R - email medicaldata@yale.edu for a workshop or tutorial based on your research needs
* OpenRefine - [A powerful tool for working with messy data, cleaning it, and transforming it from one format or structure to another](https://openrefine.org/)

##### Data Analysis Tools
* There are many proprietary analysis tools; this document will focus on what you have access to free and/or through Yale


### Version Control

### Documentation

### Data Storage

### Data Security 
* How can you know which software are cleared for moderate or high risk data? (And what are the classifications of moderate or high risk data?) [Check with Yale Information Security](https://cybersecurity.yale.edu/approved-services)

# Best Practises: File Organizatino

* Organize your folders in a way that makes sense to you, your team (if you have one), and your workflows
* Folder structures should be wider than they are deep (i.e., you do not want to need to drill deeply down within a file directory to find your files)
* If you have multiple similar projectes, analyses, experiements, consider making standardized templates to help you maintain consistancy across projects
* Document organization rules within a READme file that exists within the directory

Note: Directory and folder are interchangeable terms
